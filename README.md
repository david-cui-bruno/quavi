# Quavi

"Plans fell through? Good." A prototype where cancelled plans become a story: pick a mood, pick an opening, walk three chapters, add moments, then tell the story.

```
npm install
npm run dev      # http://127.0.0.1:5199
npm run build
```

- **Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript. No backend; state is saved in `localStorage` (Profile → "Log out & restart demo" resets it).
- **Brand:** colors, ABC Areal + Fraunces Soft, flat buttons with the brand's hover/pressed behavior (`src/index.css`).
- **Characters:** the Persona Kit ducklings, rendered as SVG from the brand file's vector data (`src/brand/partsData.ts`, `Persona.tsx`). Colorway rules keep accessories from matching the body.
- **Flow:** Splash → Welcome → (Log in | Interests → Make your Quavi) → Home → Mood → Openings → Writing → Story details → Active story (add moments, swap chapters) → Complete → Tell your story → Story shelf. Also Explore (map, destination route, stop preview), Friend's story + save to lists, Profile.
- **Content:** openings, chapters and captions are scripted in `src/data.ts`; the "writing your plot twist" screen is a timed animation, not an AI call yet.

## Arrival tasks, tracking & the game map

- **Arrival tasks:** every stop has 3 tasks with XP (e.g. at Corner Coffee: order a pastry you've never tried, ask the barista what they'd order). They unlock automatically when you're within 70 m of the stop (`ARRIVE_RADIUS` in `src/data.ts`). Clearing all three earns a bonus, coins and a place badge.
- **Tracking:** `src/tracking.tsx`. *Demo walk* fast-forwards a walker along the route; *My location* uses `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`. **Limit:** a web page can't track in the background or when closed. That needs a native app (iOS "Always" location + region monitoring, Android foreground service + geofencing), e.g. by wrapping this UI in Capacitor and moving `tracking.tsx` to a background-geolocation plugin.
- **Game map:** `src/GameMap.tsx`: XP/level HUD, your Quavi walking the trail, pulsing quest pins, collectible coins, ✓ stamps on cleared stops. Used on Active story and Explore.
